     <h1>I) Bank project</h1>
     Currentky major banks do not allow to the organization that would like to be transparent, 
     to give a visualization access to their bank account.<br/>
     Organization could release their bank statements, but nothing can prove the document would be originals.<br/>
     In the majority of cases, we use a bank to open an account or to pay what we need.<br/>
     It is therefore only those base operations that need to be implemented in a first phase.<br/>
     More precisely :
     <ul>
         <li>Be able to receive his salary or get paid for invoices by wire transfer.</li>
         <li>Be able to wire transfer to other bank accounts.</li>
         <li>Be able to pay by credit card or electronic way.</li>
         <li>Allow users that are willing to, to give a public visualization access to their account.</li>
         <li>Implement the governance of the bank as a liquid democarcy.</li>
         <li>Provide all base services as an API so that third party organization can use them to build added value services</li>
     </ul>

     <h1>II) Les actions en cours</h1>
     <h2>Contact banks</h2>
     It would be easier if the listed features were provided by an existing bank.
     It is therefore of prime imporance to contact them and ask<br/>
     <a href="https://mensuel.framapad.org/p/yellowbanklettertobank">This document is a proposal of message</a> to send to the banks<br/>
